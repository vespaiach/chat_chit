# Fonts Usage

Lato + Libre Baskerville â€“ A soft, humanist sans-serif with a classic, timeless serif.

- Lato (Sans-serif): Best for UI elements, navigation menus, buttons, and headings. Its modern, humanist style makes for clean, approachable text.
- Libre Baskerville (Serif): Great for body text and long-form content, making your articles and blog posts feel professional and easy to read.

# Suggested Styling

- Headings & Titles: Use Lato in bold or uppercase for strong visual impact (e.g., font-weight: 700).
- Body Text: Use Libre Baskerville for paragraphs with a comfortable line height (e.g., font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6).
- Navigation & UI Elements: Lato works well with slightly spaced-out letters (letter-spacing: 0.5px) to ensure clarity.
- Quotes or Callouts: If you want certain sections to stand out, consider using Libre Baskerville in italics.

# Typograph in Form

- Lato (Sans-serif): Ideal for form labels, input fields, and UI elements due to its clean and modern appearance.
- Libre Baskerville (Serif): Great for form titles, descriptions, or instructions, adding a touch of sophistication.

# Form Styling

- Labels: Lato in font-size: 14px; font-weight: 600; color: #333; keeps them readable yet distinct.
- Input Fields: Lato in font-size: 16px; font-weight: 400; ensures clarity for user entries.
- Form Title & Instructions: Libre Baskerville in font-size: 18px; font-style: italic; color: #444; to bring an elegant contrast.
- Error Messages: Lato with a red tone (color: #d9534f; font-size: 13px;) to make them clear and subtle.
